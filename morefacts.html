            <p class="lead">After 1973, the muscle car industry took a hit. 
              Rising fuel costs due to the U.S. oil crisis, increased insurance rates and the Clean Air Act both stood as obstacles for muscle car manufacturers. 
              The higher price tags also made muscle cars impractical and unaffordable for many buyers.
              The U.S. oil crisis put automakers in a strange position. While automotive technology advancements made it possible for engineers at Chevrolet, Ford, Buick, Pontiac and other brands to make sports cars faster than ever, rules and regulations from the American government made it hard to move high-performance models from dealerships — and so did consumers' willingness to spend.</p>

            <p class="lead">The Clean Air Act of 1970 made it particularly challenging for manufacturers to produce the same high-compression engines of the past that delivered the power muscle car owners were accustomed to.
              With new legislation causing fuel octane ratings to drop from the standard 100-octane fuel to 91-octane fuel, manufacturers had to reduce engine compression ratio. 
              As a result, muscle cars had decreased performance. Manufacturers also had to increase their emissions controls to combat pollution, leading to less powerful cars.</p>

            <p class="lead">There was a period of time during the early 1970s when consumers were on the hunt for smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles. 
              Compact economy cars would get drivers where they needed to go without breaking the bank at the gas pump. For that reason, there were plenty of high-performance cars like Ford Mustangs, Chevrolet Corvettes and Plymouth Barracudas collecting dust in dealership showrooms.
              While not all of these models fall under the muscle car category, there's no doubt they share similar DNA in terms of power, performance and aesthetics.</p>
